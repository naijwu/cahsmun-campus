                        <h4>Committee Functions</h4>
                        <h5>Camera and Microphone Policy</h5>
                        <p>
                            All delegates are expected to have their camera on during committee sessions. However, delegates may temporarily turn off their cameras if their internet connection is unstable, or if they are briefly leaving their computers to use the washroom or grab water. If you are turning off your camera due to connectivity issues, please notify your Staff team.
                            Delegates are expected to be on mute unless it is their turn to speak during a speaker’s list or moderated caucuses.
                        </p>
                        <h5>Chat</h5>
                        <p>
                            Alongside Slack, delegates will be able to send messages to other delegates or Staff through the “Chat” button at the bottom of their Zoom window. However, delegates are expected to refrain from using the chat for non-committee related purposes; Staff will disable the chat function if delegates are found to be off-task.
                        </p>
                        <h5>Raising Placards</h5>
                        <p>
                            Delegates will be able to raise their “placards” using the “Raise Hand” function found at the bottom of their Zoom window under the “Reactions” button. Delegates are reminded to click the “Lower Hand” button when appropriate.
                        </p>

                        <h5>Breakout Rooms</h5>
                        <p>
                            The Staff will open breakout rooms for blocs to assemble in during unmoderated caucuses. To self-select and join a breakout room, you must have updated their Zoom to version 5.3.0 or later. To enter a breakout room, you should click the “Join Breakout Room” button found at the bottom of their Zoom window, then select your desired breakout room by hovering over the “Join” button and selecting “Yes” once prompted.

                        <h5>Troubleshooting Audio</h5>
                        <p>
                            If your microphone or speakers are not working, select the small upwards arrow next to the “Unmute” button at the bottom left corner of your Zoom window. From there, select the “Test Speaker & Microphone button to test your audio settings.
                        </p>
